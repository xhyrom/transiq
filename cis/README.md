**cis** aims to make public transport timetable data from Slovakia available in the open GTFS format.

The official _Celoštátny informačný systém o cestovných poriadkoch_ (CIS CP) publishes timetable data only as PDF and XLSX files on [portal.cp.sk](http://portal.cp.sk/), but does not provide GTFS feeds to the public.

When I contacted several companies and public transport operators that have access to GTFS or JDF data, they told me that I would need to request the data **from each individual operator separately**.
As a single person, I simply do not have the capacity to contact dozens of operators, and even if I did, some — such as [_Dopravný podnik mesta Košice (DPMK)_](https://www.dpmk.sk/), refused to provide the data.

**Big shout-out** to [Bratislava](https://bratislava.sk) and [IDS BK](http://idsbk.sk/), who do provide these data in GTFS format publicly.
