**cis** aims to make public transport timetable data from Slovakia 🇸🇰 available in the open GTFS format.

The official _Celoštátny informačný systém o cestovných poriadkoch_ (CIS CP) publishes timetable data only as PDF and XLSX files on [portal.cp.sk](http://portal.cp.sk/), but does not provide GTFS feeds to the public.

When I contacted several companies and public transport operators that have access to GTFS or JDF data, they told me that I would need to request the data **from each individual operator separately**.
As a single person, I simply do not have the capacity to contact dozens of operators, and even if I did, some — such as [_Dopravný podnik mesta Košice (DPMK)_](https://www.dpmk.sk/), refused to provide the data.

**Big shout-out** to [Bratislava](https://bratislava.sk), [IDS BK](https://idsbk.sk/) and [ZSSK](https://zssk.org) ([ZSR](https://zsr.sk)), who do provide these data in GTFS format publicly.

### 📌 Current Situation

As of August 2025, the availability of public transport timetable data in GTFS format remains fragmented. Despite legal requirements under [§25 of Act No. 332/2023](https://www.slov-lex.sk/ezbierky/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2023/332/), which mandates transport operators to provide machine-readable operational data (including timetables, vehicle positions, and delay information) through a national access point, no centralized GTFS feed exists.
