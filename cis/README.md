**cis** aims to make public transport timetable data from Slovakia 🇸🇰 available in the open GTFS format.

The official _Celoštátny informačný systém o cestovných poriadkoch_ (CIS CP) publishes timetable data only as PDF and XLSX files on [portal.cp.sk](http://portal.cp.sk/), but does not provide GTFS feeds to the public.

When I contacted several companies and public transport operators that have access to GTFS or JDF data, they told me that I would need to request the data **from each individual operator separately**.
As a single person, I simply do not have the capacity to contact dozens of operators, and even if I did, some — such as [_Dopravný podnik mesta Košice (DPMK)_](https://www.dpmk.sk/), refused to provide the data.

**Big shout-out** to [Bratislava](https://bratislava.sk), [IDS BK](https://idsbk.sk/) and [ZSSK](https://zssk.org) ([ZSR](https://zsr.sk)), who do provide these data in GTFS format publicly.

### 📌 Current Situation

As of August 2025, the availability of public transport timetable data in GTFS format remains **inconsistent**. Despite legal requirements under [§ 25 of Act No. 332/2023 Z. z.](https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2023/332/), which mandates transport operators to provide machine-readable operational data — including timetables, vehicle positions, delay information, station facilities, and on-board services — through a national access point, **no centralized GTFS/JDF feed exists**.

While the law explicitly requires these datasets to be published in a format suitable for automated processing (which GTFS or JDF satisfies), many operators and municipalities fail to comply. Instead, data remain siloed, accessible only through PDFs (and sometimes XLSX) files, or proprietary formats. This situation means that, even in 2025, much of Slovakia’s public transport data is **not openly accessible** despite the legal requirements.
