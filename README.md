**transiq** (pronounced "transique") is a simple mirror for [GTFS](https://gtfs.org) data. It solves the problem of accessing transit data from sources that don't allow direct downloading using tools like `wget` or `curl` (e.g., files hosted on Google Drive).

This project was originally created to handle IDS BK regional buses GTFS data from Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° (https://www.idsbk.sk/en/about/open-data/), which is hosted on Google Drive and can't be easily accessed. However, transiq is designed to be generic, so if you want to add another feed, your contributions are appreciated :)

### Adding New Feeds

To add a new GTFS feed:

1. Create a new file in the appropriate country directory (e.g., `feed/sk/new-feed.ts`)
2. Implement the feed definition following this structure:

```typescript
import type { Feed, FileSource } from "@types";

export default {
  id: "unique-id",
  name: "Human Readable Name",
  license: {
    // License information (optional)
    type: "License Type",
    url: "https://license-url.example",
    attribution: "Attribution information",
    notes: "Additional notes about the license",
    from: "https://source-website.example",
  },
  getLatestSource: async (): Promise<FileSource> => {
    // Logic to get the latest source URL or Google Drive file ID
    return {
      type: "url", // or "google_drive"
      url: "https://example.com/gtfs.zip", // or fileId: "google_drive_file_id"
    };
  },
} satisfies Feed;
```

### Automated Updates

The repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically download and update the GTFS files daily. The updated files are stored in the [`gtfs`](https://github.com/xhyrom/transiq/tree/gtfs) branch.
