**morph** is a collection of transformation tools for GTFS feeds.

### morph.shapes

Generates `shapes.txt` using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data with the [ad-freiburg/pfaedle](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/pfaedle) tool and stop sequences.
Useful when the original feed doesn’t include shapes or they are inaccurate.
